## Installation
Make sure the following is installed: node.js, npm inquirer, npm jest.

## Usage
A cmmand-line application that accepts user input. Prompted for text,
you can enter up to three characters. When you prompted for the text color, you can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number). When you are prompted for a shape, then you are presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square. When you are prompted for the shape's color, you can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number). When you have entered input for all the prompts,
then0 an SVG file is created named `logo.svg` AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line. When you open the `logo.svg` file in a browser, then you are shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered.
